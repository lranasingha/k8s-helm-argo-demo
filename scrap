ChatGPT prompt:
I need to demonstrate how k8s + helm + argocd working together with an example. Use nginx instance as an example service. 

Use latest stable versions of the above software. I need to provision this using vagrant on qemu with ubuntu 18. So shells like bash won't be there. 

No need to create new users, print out the necessary login passwords.

I need to access the argocd and k8s from the host mac. So configure networks correctly. 

Can you create a vagrant script to achieve the above?
